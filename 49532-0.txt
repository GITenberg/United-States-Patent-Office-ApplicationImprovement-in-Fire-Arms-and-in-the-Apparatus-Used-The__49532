SAMUEL COLT, OF PATERSON, NEW JERSEY.

IMPROVEMENT IN FIRE-ARMS AND IN THE APPARATUS USED THEREWITH.

Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. 1,304, dated August
29, 1839.


_To all whom it may concern:_

Be it known that I, _Samuel Colt_, of Paterson, in the county of
Passaic and State of New Jersey, did obtain Letters Patent of the
United States for an Improvement in Fire-Arms, which Letters Patent
bear date on the 25th day of February, in the year 1836, and that
I have made certain improvements in the construction of the said
fire-arms, and also in the apparatus for loading and priming the
same; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact
description of my said improvements.

My first improvements appertain to rifles, guns, and pistols; my second
to the construction of a cap-primer for containing the percussion-caps
and placing the same upon the nipples, and my third to a flask and
other apparatus for loading the rifle or gun.

For the general construction of my fire-arms, as originally patented I
refer to the Letters Patent first above named, the same being necessary
to a perfect understanding of the improvements thereon, which I am now
about to describe.

Figure 1 in the accompanying drawings represents a section through
the lock and breech of my rifle or gun and two of the chambers of
the revolving receiver, B being a part of the barrel of the gun. The
mouths of the chambers and the end of the barrel have their edges
chamfered or beveled, as shown at _a a_ in the drawings. In all guns of
this description there is necessarily a lateral discharge between the
receiver and the barrel, and this lateral discharge may endanger the
ignition of the powder in the loaded chambers not in contact with the
barrel; but the ignited matter, by coming into contact with the beveled
edge as it crosses said chamber, is effectually reflected off, and does
not enter them. The beveling of the end of the barrel is not a thing of
importance, it being intended merely to prevent its scraping or cutting
the ball in its passage from the chamber.

Fig. 2 shows a part of the arbor upon which the receiver turns. _b_
is the portion thereof which is immediately below the chamber in
contact with the barrel, and in this part a channel or groove is made
descending from the point _b_ in both directions, so as to form two
inclined planes meeting at the point _b_. These planes or sections of
the grooves may form an angle at forty-five degrees with each other.
This groove or channel serves as a chimney to conduct off the smoke
of the lateral discharge, so that it shall pass directly between the
receiver and the barrel and prevent its spreading, so as to pass in
between the receiver and the arbor and the barrel and the arbor, and
consequently from condensing there and rendering them foul. The barrel
is connected with the receiver and with the stock of the gun by the aid
of the arbor which at the rear end, is a solid piece with the shield
or solid piece of metal which receives the recoil and constitutes a
component part of the metallic frame-work or foundation of the lock and
its appendages. The part C of the arbor is that upon which the receiver
revolves, and the part C′ enters a cylindrical cavity in a mass of
iron, D D, to which the barrel is brazed or otherwise attached.

Fig. 3 shows the piece of iron D D and a part of the barrel B which
is attached to it. The dotted lines in this represent the cylindrical
cavity which receives the outer end of the arbor C′. The two are keyed
together by the passing of a suitable key through a mortise in the
piece D D and a corresponding one in the arbor.

_c_, Figs. 1, 3, 4, and 5, represents the key. Fig. 4 shows its upper
and Fig. 5 its under side, _d d_ are two fluted channels along its
upper side to receive the heads of two screws which are screwed into
the piece D D close to the mortise and on the side opposite to that
shown in Fig. 3. The heads of these screws lap a little over the
mortise and are received into the fluted channels _d d_. These heads
prevent the key from falling out and check it in either direction, and
must be withdrawn in order to remove the key. As the key _c_ is to act
laterally as a wedge to draw the receiver and the barrel into proper
contact, it is of importance that it should be checked when forced
sufficiently far in, or the receiver might be wedged up and prevented
from turning. For this purpose I insert a screw, _e_, Fig. 3, into the
steel button _f_, which is attached to D D, to strengthen the end of
the mortise and prevent the bruising of it by the recoil. The head of
this screw, overlapping the end of the mortise, receives the wedge
and checks it. By turning this screw the force of the wedge may be
tempered. In Fig. 5, _g_ is a spring-latch on the under side of the
key, which catches upon D when the key is forced in and prevents its
accidental removal.

Fig. 6 represents a percussion tube or nipple, through which the fire
from the percussion-cap is to be conducted to the chamber. Fig. 7
represents the same in section. The outer end, _h_, of the tube has the
opening made as large as convenience will allow, and it goes tapering
or conical until at the inner end, _i_, it is as small as a proper
entrance of the flame from the percussion-powder will warrant. By
giving the conical or funnel-formed opening to the tube the effect of
the percussion-powder is greatly increased.

E, Figs. 1 and 8, is a bolt for locking the receiver when a loaded
chamber is brought to coincide with the barrel, the rounded end _j_
being forced into a hole in the receiver by the action of a spring on
its outer end _k_. This bolt is drawn back by the hammer F in the act
of cocking.

_l_, Figs. 1 and 9, is a spring-cam, which is screwed to the hammer at
_m_. It is made of spring-steel, so that its cam end _n_ may recede
from or approach the hammer F. The cam _n_ bears against the projection
_o_ on the bolt E on the side which lies against the hammer, and as the
hammer is drawn back causes the bolt to recede. The bolt is notched to
enable it to be withdrawn without interfering with the joint-pin _q_ of
the hammer. The lateral springing of the cam-piece _l_ is necessary to
admit of its passing by the projection _o_ of the bolt when the hammer
is made to strike upon a percussion-cap. To enable the spring-cam
to pass the bolt E, the lower end of it, _n_, is made wedge-shaped,
diminishing to a point or edge at its extremity, and as it is made to
spring laterally it is received into a recess in the hammer as the
latter passes the bolt in making the discharge.

Fig. 10 shows the ratchet-wheel and hand or pawl by which the receiver
is made to revolve to the distance from one chamber to another in the
act of cocking. The cylindrical periphery _q_ of the ratchet-wheel
fits into a corresponding cavity on the back end of the receiver, as
shown at _q q_, Fig. 1. _r_ is a projection to prevent its turning
round, this being adapted to a notch made to receive it. S is a hand
or pawl, which falls into the teeth of the ratchet-wheel, said pawl
being forced forward by the spring S′. The arbor _t_ on which the hand
turns is received into the opening _t_. In the hammer, Fig. 1, the hand
itself being on the opposite side of said hammer from that shown, its
position is shown by the dotted lines surrounding its arbor _t_. The
cocking of the gun causes it to act upon the ratchet-wheel, and when
turned to the proper distance the bolt E is forced by its spring into
the proper opening in the receiver. The mainspring is connected to the
lock-plate at _u_, and to the hammer by a stirrup at V. The trigger
is shown at _w_. These parts, not differing in their construction and
operation from analogous parts in other gun-locks, need no particular
description, and from the description above given of the structure and
operation of those parts of the rifle or gun which are new, the action
of the whole will, it is believed, be clearly understood.

Fig. 11 is a sectional view of a pistol, the general construction of
which is the same with that of the rifle or gun already described, such
modifications only being made as are rendered necessary by its size
and other considerations. F is the hammer carrying the hand or pawl S,
which operates on the ratchet-wheel, which wheel and hand are arranged
in the same way with the same parts in the rifle; but the hand is as
here represented on the reverse side. The bolt which holds the receiver
is, however, differently constructed to enable it to act in the space
which it must occupy.

Fig. 12 is a view of the hammer on the side the reverse of that shown
in Fig. 11; and E, Fig. 13, is the bolt adapted thereto. _j_ is the
pin on the bolt, which holds the receiver by falling into openings on
its periphery instead of in its end. The pin _j_ is shown in place in
Fig. 11. The bolt E vibrates on a joint-pin at _x_, which is nearly
in the same line with the joint-pin _y_ on the trigger, Figs. 11 and
15, by which it is hidden in those figures. _z_ is a cam formed in a
recess in the hammer, Fig. 12, which cam is to act upon the bolt E and
to disengage it from the receiver. The ends _a′ a^2_ of this bolt
are capable of receding from or approaching toward each other, as they
constitute two spring-cheeks formed by splitting or forking the bolts,
as shown in the drawings. The end _a^2_ lies above the cam _z_ on the
hammer when the pistol is not cocked, and the lower end of _a^2_,
as well as the upper end of _z_, being flat, the bolt E is lifted in
the act of cocking until the pin _j_ is disengaged, and the ends of
_a^2_ and _z_ then pass each other. The cam _z_ is made wedge shape
by sloping from its upper to its lower end, and the end _a^2_ of the
bolt is similarly formed, but in the reverse direction, so that when
the piece is discharged the end _a^2_ will be made to spring in,
allowing the hammer to pass readily, when the end _a^2_ again rests
upon _z_ as before.

Fig. 14 shows the hammer with the hand S and ratchet _q_, which need no
further description.

Fig. 15 shows the trigger and its appendages, which are formed in a
way not presenting any claim to novelty. _u_ is the attachment of the
mainspring to the lock-plate, and _v_ its attachment to the stirrup and
hammer.

Fig. 16 shows the apparatus which I employ for forcing the balls into
the chambers. _b^2 b^2_ are two of the chambers, shown in section;
and C, the arbor by which the barrel is attached to the stock and upon
which the receiver turns, as already explained. G is a lever carrying
a rammer, H, by which the balls are to be forced into the chambers.
The forward end of the lever H passes into the mortise _c^2_, which
receives the key by which the barrel is attached. The operation of the
rammer H upon the ball _d′_ will be apparent. In using this lever the
receiver is to be turned upon the arbor, and the chambers brought in
succession under the rammer. This lever, at its end _e′_, constitutes
a wrench for screwing and unscrewing the percussion-tubes, and also
contains a picker attached to a screw-cap, _f′_. A fulcrum for the
lever H may be formed on the barrel or otherwise, instead of using the
mortise _c^2_, if preferred.

Figs. 17 and 18 are a top and sectional view of my improved cap-primer,
which differs in some important particulars from the English and other
cap-primers now in use. I make a spiral groove, _a a a_, in a plate of
brass or other metal, which groove is of such depth and width as to
receive the percussion-caps, and to allow them to move freely therein.
_b b b_ are caps within said groove. In the center of the primer,
under the plate _c c_, is a spiral spring, _d d_, operating like the
mainspring of a watch upon its barrels and turning the plate _c c_.
This plate has a groove across it which carries a sliding arm, _e e′_,
having under its end _e′_ a projecting piece which enters the groove,
draws the arm out, and presses upon the row of caps. At the mouth of
the spiral groove, where the the cap _b′_ is seen, a steel spring, _f_,
checks the cap and counteracts the pressure of the spiral spring _d
d_; but when the cap _b′_ is placed upon the tube or nipple the spring
_f_ will recede by the withdrawal of the cap, and a new one will be
made to occupy its place, and so on until the whole are exhausted.
The cover _g_, which in Fig. 17 is shown as raised, is held down by a
spring-catch at _h_. There is a spring-catch at _i_, which holds the
sliding arm _e_ at its end _e′_, when it is brought round to the inner
end of the spiral groove, its use being to detain the arm while the
groove is being filled with caps, when it is to be raised, and the
arm left at liberty to operate. The spring _d d_ may be wound up by a
small key, _k_, or by inserting a screw driver in a notch made for that
purpose, or simply by forcing the arm _e e_ round until it is caught by
the catch _i_.

Fig. 19 is a representation of my ammunition-flask, by means of which
all the chambers in my receiver may be simultaneously charged with
powder and with balls. It consists of two separate chambers, one of
which is a powder and the other a bullet magazine, _a_ being the former
and _b_ the latter, the two being connected together by a bayonet-joint
at _c_. _d d d_ are charging-tubes adapted in number and position to
the mouths of the chambers of the receiver which they are to enter.

Fig. 21 shows the closed top of the powder-magazine, with a valve or
turn cover, _e_, which closes a hole through which the magazine is to
be filled. This magazine occupies the space from _f_ to _g_, Fig. 19,
where the powder is contained in bulk. The space from _g_ to _h_ is a
receptacle which is divided by partitions into separate chambers, the
same in number with the tubes _d d_, each of which chambers contains
the quantity of powder required for the charge of a single chamber,
_i i_ is the rim of this chambered receptacle, which is capable of
being turned round to a short distance by the thumb and finger for
the purpose of charging the chambers with powder. This turning round
brings openings _u u_, Fig. 20, in the lower end of the chambered box
to coincide with the openings in the tubes _d d_, so that the powder
contained in the chambers in _i i_ may pass out therefrom into the
chambers of the receiver. There are openings also in the upper plate or
top of the receptacle _i i_ corresponding with openings in the bottom
of the magazine _a_, which are closed by turning the rim _i i_, so as
to prevent powder from falling through from the magazine while the
receiver is being filled.

Fig. 27 is a section through the middle of the chambered receptacle
_i i_, the circles _r r_ representing the chambers for containing the
powder. _s s_ are the openings in the top plate of these chambers,
through which the powder is admitted into them from the magazine _a_.
The dotted lines _t t_ show the plan of the openings in the bottom
plate of the chamber _a_, the chambered receiver being shown in the
position in which those openings are covered.

In Fig. 28 the same parts are represented; but the chambered receiver
is supposed to be turned round or standing in its ordinary position,
so that the openings S S and _t t_ coincide. The chambered receptacle
is restored to its place by means of a spring of any suitable form.
The whole operation of this part will be more clearly made known by
the sectional representation of the magazine for balls, which I am now
about to describe.

The end of the flask, Fig. 19, is, I have said, the magazine for
balls. Fig. 22 is an end view of this magazine, and Fig. 23 a section
along its axis. The portion from _f_ to _j_, Figs. 19, 23, and 24, is
divided into as many tubular chambers as there are chambers in the
receiver--say five. These are open at top and are to be filled with
balls, as shown at _k k_ in the section Fig. 23. These tubes are also
open at their lower ends, so that the balls may pass from them into a
chambered receptacle, _l l_, similar to that for the powder. From this
chambered receptacle they are to fall into the chambers of the receiver
when the lower end of the flask, Fig. 22, is applied thereto for that
purpose, the openings _m m_ in the lower end of the flask being adapted
thereto. The rim of the chambered receiver _l l_ is to be turned round
to allow the balls to escape through _m m_, as already described in the
charging with powder. In Fig. 22, _n n_ are the divisions between the
chambers of the chambered receiver, and which retain one set or tier
of balls until the rim is turned around so as to cause the chambers to
coincide with the openings _m m_. The balls will then pass through. The
same motion of the chambered receiver causes the divisions between the
tubes and the chambered receiver to pass under and sustain the balls
in the magazine. In the case of the powder-magazine the action is the
same; but the powder being in fine particles, the apertures at one end
of the receptacles must be perfectly closed before those at the other
begin to be opened, which is not necessary with the balls. In Fig. 24
a portion of the exterior of the magazine is removed to show how a
spring, _o o_, may be placed within it so as to act upon _l l_; but
spiral or other springs may be placed in many ways to answer the same
purpose. The central part of both the magazines is tubular, as shown at
_p p_, said tube fitting onto the arbor C′, Fig. 16, when the barrel is
removed therefrom, and the receiver left on for the purpose of being
charged, which operation does not require to be further explained. Upon
the barrel of this tubular part the chambered receptacles are received
and revolve.

Figs. 25 and 26 represent a top view and a side view of a part of an
improved bullet-mold, which I describe without intending to make any
claim thereto, but merely for the purpose of showing the whole of the
apparatus employed in a complete and connected series. _a a_ are the
two handles of the mold, and _b_ the handle of the knife by which the
sprue is cut off. _c_ is one-half of the mold, of which _d d_ is the
hinge-joint. _e_ is a plate of steel, through which there is a hole,
_f_, for pouring in the lead, the lower edges of which constitute a
knife by which the sprue is cut off and the ball left perfect. This
knife turns on the joint-pin _g_.

Having thus fully described the manner in which I construct and use
my improved fire-arms, and the respective articles of apparatus
appertaining thereto, it has been necessary in so doing to mention many
parts which I do not claim as new, the same being similar to what has
been before used and patented by me, or which are common property. I
do hereby declare, therefore, that I limit my claim to the following
particulars.

I claim--

1. The making of a groove or channel on the arbor, as represented at
_b_, Fig. 2, for the purpose of conducting off the smoke from the
lateral discharge, and thus preserving the arbor clean within the
receiver, and the tube by which the barrel is connected.

2. The particular manner of forming and governing the key by which
the barrel is attached to the stock by making the same with grooves
in which the heads of overlapping screw-heads are received, and with
a tempering-screw to check and regulate its action as a wedge, as set
forth.

3. The making the aperture through the tubes or nipples (which receive
the percussion-caps) conical or funnel-shaped, for the purpose of
freely admitting the fire from the percussion-cap and concentrating it
as it enters the chamber.

4. The manner of arranging the bolt E of the rifle and its spring
cam _l n_ for locking and unlocking the receiver, the same being
constructed and operating as herein described.

5. The manner of constructing and arranging the bolt E and its
spring-cam, operated upon by the cam or projecting piece _z_ under that
modification thereof adopted in the pistol, and herein fully made known.

6. The improved manner of arranging the ratchet-wheel and band, as
set forth, by which the hinge-joint to allow of the lateral motion of
this band, as described by me in my former patent, is dispensed with
in consequence of the placing of the ratchet-teeth on the face instead
of on the side of the wheel, and operating the same in the manner
described, as applied to the rifle and to the pistol.

7. The combination of the lever with its rammer for forcing the balls
into the chambers of the receiver, as described.

8. In the improved cap-primer, the making thereof with a spiral groove
to receive the caps, and with the sliding arm acted upon by the spiral
spring elongating itself and forcing the percussion-caps forward in the
manner set forth.

9. The manner of constructing and arranging the respective parts of
the magazines for powder and balls, in the flask, by means of which
the powder and the balls are in turn supplied to all the chambers in
the receiver at the same time, the whole being made with the chambered
receptacles and other parts, as set forth.

Disclaimer forming part of Letters Patent No. 1,304, dated August 29,
1839.

_To the Honorable Commissioner of Patents:_

The petition of SAMUEL COLT, of Hartford, in the State of Connecticut,
respectfully represents that he is the sole patentee and owner of
Letters Patent granted to him on the 29th day of August, 1839, for an
improvement in fire-arms and in the apparatus used therewith; that
he has reason to believe that through inadvertence and mistake the
claim made in the specification of said Letters Patent is too broad,
including that of which the said patentee was not the first inventor,
although he avers that he was an original inventor thereof, and had no
knowledge when he applied for Letters Patent therefor that any other
person had ever used the said improvement before that time.

Your petitioner therefore hereby enters his disclaimer to that part
of the claim in the before-mentioned specification which is in the
following words, viz:

“I claim making the aperture through the tubes or nipples (which
receive the percussion-caps) conical or funnel shaped, for the purpose
of freely admitting the fire from the percussion-cap and concentrating
it as it enters the chamber,” which disclaimer is to operate to
the extent of the interest in said Letters Patent vested in your
petitioner, the same being the whole right, title, and interest thereby
granted to him, as aforesaid, he having paid ten dollars into the
Treasury of the United States agreeably to the provisions of the act of
Congress in that case made and provided.

Dated at Hartford this 5th day of August, A. D. 1853.

                                                          SAM. COLT.

    In presence of--
        L. P. SARGEANT.

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
