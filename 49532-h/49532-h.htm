<span class="small">IMPROVEMENT IN FIRE-ARMS AND IN THE APPARATUS USED THEREWITH.</span><br />
————————</div>
<p class='center'>Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. <b>1,304</b>, dated August 29, 1839.</p>


<p class="unindent"><i>To all whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p>Be it known that I, <i>Samuel Colt</i>, of Paterson,
in the county of Passaic and State of
New Jersey, did obtain Letters Patent of the
United States for an Improvement in Fire-Arms,
which Letters Patent bear date on the
25th day of February, in the year 1836, and
that I have made certain improvements in the
construction of the said fire-arms, and also in
the apparatus for loading and priming the
same; and I do hereby declare that the following
is a full and exact description of my said
improvements.</p>

<p>My first improvements appertain to rifles,
guns, and pistols; my second to the construction
of a cap-primer for containing the percussion-caps
and placing the same upon the nipples,
and my third to a flask and other apparatus
for loading the rifle or gun.</p>

<p>For the general construction of my fire-arms,
as originally patented I refer to the Letters
Patent first above named, the same being necessary
to a perfect understanding of the improvements
thereon, which I am now about to
describe.</p>

<p>Figure 1 in the accompanying drawings represents
a section through the lock and breech
of my rifle or gun and two of the chambers of
the revolving receiver, B being a part of the
barrel of the gun. The mouths of the chambers
and the end of the barrel have their edges
chamfered or beveled, as shown at <i>a a</i> in the
drawings. In all guns of this description there
is necessarily a lateral discharge between the
receiver and the barrel, and this lateral discharge
may endanger the ignition of the powder
in the loaded chambers not in contact with
the barrel; but the ignited matter, by coming
into contact with the beveled edge as it crosses
said chamber, is effectually reflected off, and
does not enter them. The beveling of the end
of the barrel is not a thing of importance, it
being intended merely to prevent its scraping
or cutting the ball in its passage from the
chamber.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 shows a part of the arbor upon which
the receiver turns. <i>b</i> is the portion thereof
which is immediately below the chamber in contact
with the barrel, and in this part a channel or
groove is made descending from the point <i>b</i> in
both directions, so as to form two inclined planes
meeting at the point <i>b</i>. These planes or sections
of the grooves may form an angle at forty-five
degrees with each other. This groove
or channel serves as a chimney to conduct off
the smoke of the lateral discharge, so that it
shall pass directly between the receiver and
the barrel and prevent its spreading, so as to
pass in between the receiver and the arbor and
the barrel and the arbor, and consequently
from condensing there and rendering them
foul. The barrel is connected with the receiver
and with the stock of the gun by the aid of
the arbor which at the rear end, is a solid
piece with the shield or solid piece of metal
which receives the recoil and constitutes a
component part of the metallic frame-work or
foundation of the lock and its appendages.
The part C of the arbor is that upon which the
receiver revolves, and the part C′ enters a cylindrical
cavity in a mass of iron, D D, to which
the barrel is brazed or otherwise attached.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 shows the piece of iron D D and a
part of the barrel B which is attached to it.
The dotted lines in this represent the cylindrical
cavity which receives the outer end of the arbor
C′. The two are keyed together by the
passing of a suitable key through a mortise in
the piece D D and a corresponding one in the
arbor.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, Figs. 1, 3, 4, and 5, represents the key.
Fig. 4 shows its upper and Fig. 5 its under
side, <i>d d</i> are two fluted channels along its
upper side to receive the heads of two screws
which are screwed into the piece D D close to
the mortise and on the side opposite to that
shown in Fig. 3. The heads of these screws
lap a little over the mortise and are received
into the fluted channels <i>d d</i>. These heads prevent
the key from falling out and check it in
either direction, and must be withdrawn in order
to remove the key. As the key <i>c</i> is to act
laterally as a wedge to draw the receiver and
the barrel into proper contact, it is of importance
that it should be checked when forced
sufficiently far in, or the receiver might be
wedged up and prevented from turning. For
this purpose I insert a screw, <i>e</i>, Fig. 3, into the
steel button <i>f</i>, which is attached to D D, to
strengthen the end of the mortise and prevent
the bruising of it by the recoil. The head of
this screw, overlapping the end of the mortise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
receives the wedge and checks it. By turning
this screw the force of the wedge may be tempered.
In Fig. 5, <i>g</i> is a spring-latch on the under
side of the key, which catches upon D
when the key is forced in and prevents its accidental
removal.</p>

<p>Fig. 6 represents a percussion tube or nipple,
through which the fire from the percussion-cap
is to be conducted to the chamber. Fig.
7 represents the same in section. The outer end,
<i>h</i>, of the tube has the opening made as large
as convenience will allow, and it goes tapering
or conical until at the inner end, <i>i</i>, it is as small
as a proper entrance of the flame from the percussion-powder
will warrant. By giving the
conical or funnel-formed opening to the tube
the effect of the percussion-powder is greatly
increased.</p>

<p>E, Figs. 1 and 8, is a bolt for locking the
receiver when a loaded chamber is brought
to coincide with the barrel, the rounded end <i>j</i>
being forced into a hole in the receiver by the
action of a spring on its outer end <i>k</i>. This
bolt is drawn back by the hammer F in the
act of cocking.</p>

<p><i>l</i>, Figs. 1 and 9, is a spring-cam, which is
screwed to the hammer at <i>m</i>. It is made of
spring-steel, so that its cam end <i>n</i> may recede
from or approach the hammer F. The cam <i>n</i>
bears against the projection <i>o</i> on the bolt E
on the side which lies against the hammer,
and as the hammer is drawn back causes the
bolt to recede. The bolt is notched to enable
it to be withdrawn without interfering with
the joint-pin <i>q</i> of the hammer. The lateral
springing of the cam-piece <i>l</i> is necessary to admit
of its passing by the projection <i>o</i> of the
bolt when the hammer is made to strike upon
a percussion-cap. To enable the spring-cam
to pass the bolt E, the lower end of it, <i>n</i>, is
made wedge-shaped, diminishing to a point or
edge at its extremity, and as it is made to
spring laterally it is received into a recess in
the hammer as the latter passes the bolt in
making the discharge.</p>

<p>Fig. 10 shows the ratchet-wheel and hand
or pawl by which the receiver is made to revolve
to the distance from one chamber to another
in the act of cocking. The cylindrical
periphery <i>q</i> of the ratchet-wheel fits into a
corresponding cavity on the back end of the
receiver, as shown at <i>q q</i>, Fig. 1. <i>r</i> is a projection
to prevent its turning round, this being
adapted to a notch made to receive it. S is a
hand or pawl, which falls into the teeth of the
ratchet-wheel, said pawl being forced forward
by the spring S′. The arbor <i>t</i> on which the
hand turns is received into the opening <i>t</i>. In
the hammer, Fig. 1, the hand itself being on
the opposite side of said hammer from that
shown, its position is shown by the dotted
lines surrounding its arbor <i>t</i>. The cocking of
the gun causes it to act upon the ratchet-wheel,
and when turned to the proper distance the
bolt E is forced by its spring into the proper
opening in the receiver. The mainspring is
connected to the lock-plate at <i>u</i>, and to the
hammer by a stirrup at V. The trigger is
shown at <i>w</i>. These parts, not differing in their
construction and operation from analogous
parts in other gun-locks, need no particular
description, and from the description above
given of the structure and operation of those
parts of the rifle or gun which are new, the
action of the whole will, it is believed, be
clearly understood.</p>

<p>Fig. 11 is a sectional view of a pistol, the
general construction of which is the same
with that of the rifle or gun already described,
such modifications only being made as are
rendered necessary by its size and other considerations.
F is the hammer carrying the
hand or pawl S, which operates on the ratchet-wheel,
which wheel and hand are arranged in
the same way with the same parts in the rifle;
but the hand is as here represented on the reverse
side. The bolt which holds the receiver
is, however, differently constructed to enable
it to act in the space which it must occupy.</p>

<p>Fig. 12 is a view of the hammer on the side
the reverse of that shown in Fig. 11; and E,
Fig. 13, is the bolt adapted thereto. <i>j</i> is the
pin on the bolt, which holds the receiver by
falling into openings on its periphery instead
of in its end. The pin <i>j</i> is shown in place in
Fig. 11. The bolt E vibrates on a joint-pin at
<i>x</i>, which is nearly in the same line with the
joint-pin <i>y</i> on the trigger, Figs. 11 and 15,
by which it is hidden in those figures. <i>z</i> is a
cam formed in a recess in the hammer, Fig.
12, which cam is to act upon the bolt E and
to disengage it from the receiver. The ends
<i>a′ a<sup>2</sup></i> of this bolt are capable of receding from
or approaching toward each other, as they constitute
two spring-cheeks formed by splitting
or forking the bolts, as shown in the drawings.
The end <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> lies above the cam <i>z</i> on the hammer
when the pistol is not cocked, and the lower
end of <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>, as well as the upper end of <i>z</i>, being
flat, the bolt E is lifted in the act of cocking
until the pin <i>j</i> is disengaged, and the ends of
<i>a<sup>2</sup></i> and <i>z</i> then pass each other. The cam <i>z</i> is
made wedge shape by sloping from its upper
to its lower end, and the end <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> of the bolt is
similarly formed, but in the reverse direction,
so that when the piece is discharged the end
<i>a<sup>2</sup></i> will be made to spring in, allowing the hammer
to pass readily, when the end <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> again
rests upon <i>z</i> as before.</p>

<p>Fig. 14 shows the hammer with the hand S
and ratchet <i>q</i>, which need no further description.</p>

<p>Fig. 15 shows the trigger and its appendages,
which are formed in a way not presenting any
claim to novelty. <i>u</i> is the attachment of the
mainspring to the lock-plate, and <i>v</i> its attachment
to the stirrup and hammer.</p>

<p>Fig. 16 shows the apparatus which I employ
for forcing the balls into the chambers. <i>b<sup>2</sup> b<sup>2</sup></i>
are two of the chambers, shown in section; and
C, the arbor by which the barrel is attached to
the stock and upon which the receiver turns,
as already explained. G is a lever carrying a
rammer, H, by which the balls are to be forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
into the chambers. The forward end of the
lever H passes into the mortise <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, which receives
the key by which the barrel is attached.
The operation of the rammer H upon the ball
<i>d′</i> will be apparent. In using this lever the
receiver is to be turned upon the arbor, and
the chambers brought in succession under the
rammer. This lever, at its end <i>e′</i>, constitutes
a wrench for screwing and unscrewing the percussion-tubes,
and also contains a picker attached
to a screw-cap, <i>f′</i>. A fulcrum for the
lever H may be formed on the barrel or otherwise,
instead of using the mortise <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, if preferred.</p>

<p>Figs. 17 and 18 are a top and sectional view
of my improved cap-primer, which differs in
some important particulars from the English
and other cap-primers now in use. I make a
spiral groove, <i>a a a</i>, in a plate of brass or other
metal, which groove is of such depth and width
as to receive the percussion-caps, and to allow
them to move freely therein. <i>b b b</i> are caps
within said groove. In the center of the primer,
under the plate <i>c c</i>, is a spiral spring, <i>d d</i>, operating
like the mainspring of a watch upon
its barrels and turning the plate <i>c c</i>. This
plate has a groove across it which carries a
sliding arm, <i>e e′</i>, having under its end <i>e′</i> a projecting
piece which enters the groove, draws
the arm out, and presses upon the row of caps.
At the mouth of the spiral groove, where the
the cap <i>b′</i> is seen, a steel spring, <i>f</i>, checks the
cap and counteracts the pressure of the spiral
spring <i>d d</i>; but when the cap <i>b′</i> is placed upon
the tube or nipple the spring <i>f</i> will recede by
the withdrawal of the cap, and a new one will
be made to occupy its place, and so on until
the whole are exhausted. The cover <i>g</i>, which
in Fig. 17 is shown as raised, is held down by
a spring-catch at <i>h</i>. There is a spring-catch
at <i>i</i>, which holds the sliding arm <i>e</i> at its end
<i>e′</i>, when it is brought round to the inner end
of the spiral groove, its use being to detain the
arm while the groove is being filled with caps,
when it is to be raised, and the arm left at
liberty to operate. The spring <i>d d</i> may be
wound up by a small key, <i>k</i>, or by inserting a
screw driver in a notch made for that purpose,
or simply by forcing the arm <i>e e</i> round until it
is caught by the catch <i>i</i>.</p>

<p>Fig. 19 is a representation of my ammunition-flask,
by means of which all the chambers
in my receiver may be simultaneously charged
with powder and with balls. It consists of two
separate chambers, one of which is a powder
and the other a bullet magazine, <i>a</i> being the
former and <i>b</i> the latter, the two being connected
together by a bayonet-joint at <i>c</i>. <i>d d d</i> are
charging-tubes adapted in number and position
to the mouths of the chambers of the receiver
which they are to enter.</p>

<p>Fig. 21 shows the closed top of the powder-magazine,
with a valve or turn cover, <i>e</i>, which
closes a hole through which the magazine
is to be filled. This magazine occupies the
space from <i>f</i> to <i>g</i>, Fig. 19, where the powder
is contained in bulk. The space from <i>g</i> to <i>h</i>
is a receptacle which is divided by partitions
into separate chambers, the same in number
with the tubes <i>d d</i>, each of which chambers
contains the quantity of powder required for
the charge of a single chamber, <i>i i</i> is the
rim of this chambered receptacle, which is
capable of being turned round to a short distance
by the thumb and finger for the purpose
of charging the chambers with powder. This
turning round brings openings <i>u u</i>, Fig. 20, in
the lower end of the chambered box to coincide
with the openings in the tubes <i>d d</i>, so that
the powder contained in the chambers in <i>i i</i>
may pass out therefrom into the chambers of
the receiver. There are openings also in the
upper plate or top of the receptacle <i>i i</i> corresponding
with openings in the bottom of the
magazine <i>a</i>, which are closed by turning the
rim <i>i i</i>, so as to prevent powder from falling
through from the magazine while the receiver
is being filled.</p>

<p>Fig. 27 is a section through the middle of the
chambered receptacle <i>i i</i>, the circles <i>r r</i> representing
the chambers for containing the powder.
<i>s s</i> are the openings in the top plate of
these chambers, through which the powder is
admitted into them from the magazine <i>a</i>. The
dotted lines <i>t t</i> show the plan of the openings
in the bottom plate of the chamber <i>a</i>, the chambered
receiver being shown in the position in
which those openings are covered.</p>

<p>In Fig. 28 the same parts are represented;
but the chambered receiver is supposed to be
turned round or standing in its ordinary position,
so that the openings S S and <i>t t</i> coincide.
The chambered receptacle is restored to its
place by means of a spring of any suitable form.
The whole operation of this part will be more
clearly made known by the sectional representation
of the magazine for balls, which I am
now about to describe.</p>

<p>The end of the flask, Fig. 19, is, I have said,
the magazine for balls. Fig. 22 is an end view
of this magazine, and Fig. 23 a section along
its axis. The portion from <i>f</i> to <i>j</i>, Figs. 19, 23,
and 24, is divided into as many tubular chambers
as there are chambers in the receiver&mdash;say
five. These are open at top and are to be
filled with balls, as shown at <i>k k</i> in the section
Fig. 23. These tubes are also open at their
lower ends, so that the balls may pass from
them into a chambered receptacle, <i>l l</i>, similar
to that for the powder. From this chambered
receptacle they are to fall into the chambers
of the receiver when the lower end of the flask,
Fig. 22, is applied thereto for that purpose, the
openings <i>m m</i> in the lower end of the flask being
adapted thereto. The rim of the chambered
receiver <i>l l</i> is to be turned round to allow
the balls to escape through <i>m m</i>, as already
described in the charging with powder.
In Fig. 22, <i>n n</i> are the divisions between the
chambers of the chambered receiver, and which
retain one set or tier of balls until the rim is
turned around so as to cause the chambers to
coincide with the openings <i>m m</i>. The balls will
then pass through. The same motion of the
chambered receiver causes the divisions between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the tubes and the chambered receiver
to pass under and sustain the balls in the magazine.
In the case of the powder-magazine
the action is the same; but the powder being
in fine particles, the apertures at one end of the
receptacles must be perfectly closed before
those at the other begin to be opened, which is
not necessary with the balls. In Fig. 24 a portion
of the exterior of the magazine is removed
to show how a spring, <i>o o</i>, may be placed within
it so as to act upon <i>l l</i>; but spiral or other springs
may be placed in many ways to answer the
same purpose. The central part of both the
magazines is tubular, as shown at <i>p p</i>, said
tube fitting onto the arbor C′, Fig. 16, when
the barrel is removed therefrom, and the receiver
left on for the purpose of being charged,
which operation does not require to be further
explained. Upon the barrel of this tubular
part the chambered receptacles are received
and revolve.</p>

<p>Figs. 25 and 26 represent a top view and a
side view of a part of an improved bullet-mold,
which I describe without intending to make
any claim thereto, but merely for the purpose
of showing the whole of the apparatus employed
in a complete and connected series.
<i>a a</i> are the two handles of the mold, and <i>b</i> the
handle of the knife by which the sprue is cut
off. <i>c</i> is one-half of the mold, of which <i>d d</i> is
the hinge-joint. <i>e</i> is a plate of steel, through
which there is a hole, <i>f</i>, for pouring in the lead,
the lower edges of which constitute a knife by
which the sprue is cut off and the ball left perfect.
This knife turns on the joint-pin <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus fully described the manner in
which I construct and use my improved fire-arms,
and the respective articles of apparatus
appertaining thereto, it has been necessary in
so doing to mention many parts which I do not
claim as new, the same being similar to what
has been before used and patented by me, or
which are common property. I do hereby declare,
therefore, that I limit my claim to the
following particulars.</p>

<p>I claim—<br /></p>

<p>1. The making of a groove or channel on
the arbor, as represented at <i>b</i>, Fig. 2, for the
purpose of conducting off the smoke from the
lateral discharge, and thus preserving the arbor
clean within the receiver, and the tube by
which the barrel is connected.</p>

<p>2. The particular manner of forming and
governing the key by which the barrel is attached
to the stock by making the same with
grooves in which the heads of overlapping
screw-heads are received, and with a tempering-screw
to check and regulate its action as a
wedge, as set forth.</p>

<p>3. The making the aperture through the tubes
or nipples (which receive the percussion-caps)
conical or funnel-shaped, for the purpose of
freely admitting the fire from the percussion-cap
and concentrating it as it enters the chamber.</p>

<p>4. The manner of arranging the bolt E of
the rifle and its spring cam <i>l n</i> for locking and
unlocking the receiver, the same being constructed
and operating as herein described.</p>

<p>5. The manner of constructing and arranging
the bolt E and its spring-cam, operated
upon by the cam or projecting piece <i>z</i> under
that modification thereof adopted in the pistol,
and herein fully made known.</p>

<p>6. The improved manner of arranging the
ratchet-wheel and band, as set forth, by which
the hinge-joint to allow of the lateral motion
of this band, as described by me in my former
patent, is dispensed with in consequence of
the placing of the ratchet-teeth on the face instead
of on the side of the wheel, and operating
the same in the manner described, as applied
to the rifle and to the pistol.</p>

<p>7. The combination of the lever with its rammer
for forcing the balls into the chambers of
the receiver, as described.</p>

<p>8. In the improved cap-primer, the making
thereof with a spiral groove to receive the caps,
and with the sliding arm acted upon by the
spiral spring elongating itself and forcing the
percussion-caps forward in the manner set
forth.</p>

<p>9. The manner of constructing and arranging
the respective parts of the magazines for
powder and balls, in the flask, by means of
which the powder and the balls are in turn
supplied to all the chambers in the receiver at
the same time, the whole being made with the
chambered receptacles and other parts, as
set forth.</p>

<p class="center">Disclaimer forming part of Letters Patent No. <b>1,304</b>, dated August 29, 1839.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>To the Honorable Commissioner of Patents:</i></p>

<p>The petition of <span class="smcap">Samuel Colt</span>, of Hartford,
in the State of Connecticut, respectfully represents
that he is the sole patentee and owner of
Letters Patent granted to him on the 29th day
of August, 1839, for an improvement in fire-arms
and in the apparatus used therewith;
that he has reason to believe that through inadvertence
and mistake the claim made in the
specification of said Letters Patent is too broad,
including that of which the said patentee was not
the first inventor, although he avers that he
was an original inventor thereof, and had no
knowledge when he applied for Letters Patent
therefor that any other person had ever used
the said improvement before that time.</p>

<p>Your petitioner therefore hereby enters his
disclaimer to that part of the claim in the before-mentioned
specification which is in the following
words, viz:</p>

<p>“I claim making the aperture through the
tubes or nipples (which receive the percussion-caps)
conical or funnel shaped, for the purpose
of freely admitting the fire from the percussion-cap
and concentrating it as it enters the chamber,”
which disclaimer is to operate to the extent
of the interest in said Letters Patent vested
in your petitioner, the same being the whole
right, title, and interest thereby granted to
him, as aforesaid, he having paid ten dollars
into the Treasury of the United States agreeably
to the provisions of the act of Congress in
that case made and provided.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
